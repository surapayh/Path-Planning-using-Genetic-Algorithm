# Path-Planning-using-Genetic-Algorithm
Autonomous Navigation is an extensively researched area in the field of robotics. Path Planning is an essential aspect of Navigation. There are many approches in which this issue can be addressed such as [Cell Decomposition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/lecture/Chap6-CellDecomp_howie.pdf) approach, [Road map](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/lecture/Chap5-RoadMap-Methods_howie.pdf) approach, [Artificial Potential Field](https://medium.com/@rymshasiddiqui/path-planning-using-potential-field-algorithm-a30ad12bdb08), Evolutionary Algorithm approach depending upon the situation.
## Overview
Here we implemented Evolutionary Algorithm based approach. Genetic Algorithm provides a powerful scalable optimization approach. We modified the genetic algorithm slghtly by adding a Distinguishing Algorithm to check the feasibility of the paths generated by the algorithm. Care should be taken to avoid premature convergence of the algorithm
